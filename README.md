# CryptoBlades fight simulator

This is a Chrome extension that will help you to know the exact win rate percentage you have on each cryptoblades fight.

DISCLAIMER: This is an independent development, I'm not part of the Cryptoblades team and this is not an official tool, if you have doubts you can always check the code :)
## How does it work?

It will automatically collect all the data necessary to simulate a fight:
* Character Power
* Character Element
* Weapon stats (Power, element and LB power)
